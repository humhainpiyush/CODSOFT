# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP PROJECTS

This repository consist of several projects that were entrusted to me by CODSOFT during my internship. They are:

1. **Guessing Game Project:**
   🎮 Task 1 - In my first project, I designed an engaging Guessing Game. Users had 5 attempts to guess a hidden number, and I incorporated logic to track the number of rounds played and the total attempts made. This project tested my Java programming skills and introduced me to interactive game development.

2. **Student Grade Calculator:**
   📚 Task 2 - I developed a Student Grade Calculator, which calculated a student's performance based on scores in five subjects: Hindi, English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science. The calculator assigned a grade and computed the overall percentage, challenging my problem-solving skills and programming knowledge.

3. **ATM Machine User Interface:**
   🏦💳 Task 3 - The final project in my internship involved creating a user-friendly ATM Machine interface. I designed two classes, "BankAccount" to store user balances and "ATMMachine" to provide essential functions, including checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, and secure exit. This project marked a significant step into the world of finance and secure user interactions.

These projects have allowed me to apply my programming skills in diverse areas, from game development to educational tools and secure financial interfaces. Each one has been a stepping stone in my journey of learning and growth at Codsoft. 🚀🌟
